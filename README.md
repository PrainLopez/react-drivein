# react-drivein

This is a [T3 Stack](https://create.t3.gg/) project bootstrapped with `create-t3-app`.
following Theo's [2025 React fullstack tutorial](https://youtu.be/c-hKSbzooAg?si=l2Yf-q3n-_sI_VuM)

## TODO

- [ ] Setup database and data model
- [ ] Move folder open state for URL
- [ ] Add auth
- [ ] Add file uploading *(cuz upload wtihout auth would be silly)*
